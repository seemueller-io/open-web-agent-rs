Market Hits Three-Year Low in Trading and Sales: Report"]},"description":{"type":"string","examples":["Annual NFT trading volumes fell by 19%, while sales counts dipped by 18% compared to 2023, according to DappRadar."]},"content":{"type":"string","examples":["The NFT market suffered a dismal 2024, with trading volumes and sales counts dropping to their weakest levels since 2020.\n\nAnnual trading volumes fell by 19%, while sales counts dipped by 18% compared to 2023, according to a report by blockchain analytics platform.\n\nDespite a surge in crypto market activity, driven by Bitcoin’s all-time highs and booming DeFi growth, NFTs appeared to struggle under the weight of their own inflated valuations.\n\nEarly in the year, NFT trading volumes reached $5.3 billion in Q1, a modest 4% increase compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nHowever, this momentum proved fleeting, as volumes plummeted to $1.5 billion in Q3 before recovering slightly to $2.6 billion in Q4.\n\nEven with these fluctuations, annual sales counts fell sharply, pointing to a broader trend: while individual NFTs became more expensive in line with rising crypto token prices, overall market engagement dwindled.\n\nYuga Labs’ flagship collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) hit historic lows, with floor prices dropping to 15 ETH and 2.4 ETH, respectively.\n\nEven Otherdeeds for Yuga Labs' Otherside metaverse plummeted to 0.23 ETH, a far cry from their initial minting price, exposing cracks in Yuga’s high-priced, membership-driven model.\n\nThis coincided with DappRadar’s observation that “Perhaps 2024 helped us realize that NFTs don’t need to be expensive to prove their importance in the broader Web3 ecosystem,” a critique of the market’s reliance on exclusivity and inflated pricing.\n\nAmid this downturn, the NFT market witnessed a paradox in November when CryptoPunk #8348, a rare seven-trait collectible from the NFT collection, was collateralized for a $2.75 million loan via the NFT lending platform GONDI.\n\nTouted as a milestone for NFTs as financial assets, this event showed speculative excess when juxtaposed with DappRadar’s insights about affordability and utility.\n\nWhile high-profile transactions like this aim to affirm NFTs’ value, they also highlight a market still driven by exclusivity and inflated pricing, even as wider participation wanes.\n\nEven within the struggling sector, blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks defied trends, nearly doubling in USD value in 2024 with notable sales driving brief recovery periods.\n\nNFT platforms like Blur dominated marketplace activity, leveraging zero-fee trading and aggressive airdrop campaigns to capture the largest share of trading volumes.\n\nIn contrast, rival marketplace OpenSea struggled with regulatory headwinds and declining market sentiment, forcing significant layoffs by year-end.\n\nBy Q4, Blur and OpenSea were neck-and-neck in market share, but Blur’s ability to generate high activity from a smaller, more active user base gave it the edge, as per the report.\n\nWhile trading volumes in late 2024 hinted at a potential recovery—November sales hit $562 million, the highest since May—the overall trajectory suggests that affordability, accessibility, and utility will be critical for sustained growth in 2025."]},"medium":{"type":"string","examples":["Article"]},"links":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string","examples":["https://dappradar.com/blog/dapp-industry-report-2024-overview"]}},"labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string","examples":["Roundup"]}}}},"matchedAuthors":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{},"name":{"type":"string","examples":["Vismaya
